# GNACODE's PCRSIM and Primer Design

We made this tool to combine the Primer3 design algorithms available via the Python library "primer3"

Hereto, we also publish our most interesting application in scientific journals and host the public repositories for those publications here as well

MLM-IV-Theory Plots, generates the theoretial plot by Merlino 2007, and overlays experimental artifacts as leakage current for ions and electrons, and a capacitive rounding of the "knee". We use the functions (3) and (6) from the Merlino 2007 paper. Merlino RL has made a Maple program doing the same, this here is an easier accessible Python version using Plotly as plotting engine.

MLM-IV-SimPlot, generates a range of IV curves with different eV energies, based on the theoretical plot from MLM-IV-Theory Plots but incorporates the leakage currents for ions and electrons and adds the rounding of the "knee". The function is run a number of times with and sampled with gaussian noise from scipy. It outputs the different plots as files in the NPY plot format and they can be read by e.g. PlasmaPy. The plasma settings at the top of the Python file makes it easier to specify all relevant parameters for a Plasma like:
- electron concentration [ne], 
- ion concentration [ni], 
- electron temperature[Te], 
- ion temperature [Ti], 
- floating potential [Vf], 
- plasma potential [Vp]

MLM-IV-Analysis, uses a straight forward IV curve analysis outlined in Handout for Plasma Physics: Plasma Probes, by Jeremiah Willams, Physics Department, Wittenberg University, 2014. We found that this fitting method gives better results than [PlasmaPy](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy), which is easy to try because [PlasmaPy](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy) can read the NPY files generated by MLV-IV-SimPlot

- Final Estimated Electron Temperature (Te) = 1.91 eV
- Final Estimated Plasma Potential (Vp) = 4.62 V (from derivative peak)
- Final Estimated Plasma Potential (Vp) = 5.45 V (from line crossing)
- Final Estimated Electron Saturation Current (Ie_sat) = 2.32e-03 A

MLM-IV-EEDF-Analysis, is a second method to fit for electron density [ne], and electron temperature [Te]. We found that an average of [Te]  we found in MLM-IV-Analysis and MLM-IV-EEDF-Analysis fits with the orignal [Te] provided for the simulation

 - Abstract:
  - I give several simple examples of model Langmuir probe current-voltage (I-V) characteristics that help students learn how to interpret real I-V characteristics obtained in a plasma. Students can also create their own Langmuir probe I-V characteristics using a program with the plasma density, plasma potential, electron temperature, ion temperature, and probe area as input parameters. Some examples of Langmuir probe I-V characteristics obtained in laboratory plasmas are presented and analyzed. A few comments are made advocating the inclusion of plasma experiments in the advanced undergraduate laboratory.
